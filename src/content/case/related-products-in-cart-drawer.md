overview: "On Avon Lebanon, recommended related products were displayed in the cart drawer to increase order value. Relevant suggestions at checkout encouraged cross-selling, resulting in higher sales."
challenge: "Customers often reached the cart without exploring additional relevant products, resulting in missed cross-sell opportunities and lower average order values."
hypothesis: "Displaying related product recommendations in the cart drawer will encourage users to add more items to their cart, increasing average order value."
implementation: "Introduced a Others Customers Also Bought section in the cart drawer, featuring items relevant to the user's current selections. A/B tested the placement and layout to optimise click-through rates."
outcome: "Increased AOV due to additional items being added to the cart through product recommendations."
