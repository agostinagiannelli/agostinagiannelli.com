hypothesis: "Adding suggestions and displaying first-matching products directly in the search bar will enable users to find what they want faster, improving product discovery."
implementation: "Enhanced the search functionality by displaying suggestions and first-matching products directly in the search bar, optimising for speed and accuracy. A/B tested this feature against the old search system."
