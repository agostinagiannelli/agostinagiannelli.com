overview: "Showed previously viewed items on Avon UK's homepage for easy return. Displaying recent items enhances user experience and increases the likelihood of conversion."
challenge: "Users were forgetting or overlooking products they previously viewed, leading to lower return visits and missed conversion opportunities."
hypothesis: "Displaying users' recently viewed items on the homepage will make it easier for them to return to products of interest, increasing engagement and conversions."
implementation: "Implemented a “Recently Viewed” section on the homepage to surface items users had interacted with earlier. A/B tested the placement and visibility to maximise user engagement."
outcome: "Higher return engagement from users, with an increase in product revisits and conversions."
