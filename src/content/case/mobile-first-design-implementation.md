overview: "Implemented mobile-first design on Avon UK for a seamless experience across all screen sizes. Mobile optimisation enhances engagement and boosts conversion rates across devices."
challenge: "A significant portion of users accessed the site from mobile devices, but they faced a poor user experience due to a non-optimised design, leading to high bounce rates and low conversion rates on mobile."
hypothesis: "Implementing a mobile-first design will provide a seamless experience across all screen sizes, leading to higher engagement on mobile devices."
implementation: "Worked closely with UX and development teams to create a responsive, mobile-optimised layout. Prioritised a clean and intuitive mobile experience, ensuring key touchpoints were easily accessible on smaller screens."
outcome: "Improved mobile conversion rates and a significant reduction in bounce rates for mobile users."
