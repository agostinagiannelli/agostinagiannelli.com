overview: "On Avon UK, recommended related products were added to the cart page to encourage add-ons and reach free delivery thresholds, driving up cart value and conversions."
challenge: "Many users completed purchases without reaching the threshold for free delivery or exploring additional products, resulting in lost opportunities for cross-sell and upsell."
hypothesis: "Displaying relevant product recommendations in the cart with prompts to reach free delivery will motivate users to add more items, increasing average order value and conversion rates."
implementation: "Added a targeted recommendation section in the cart for users below the free delivery threshold. A/B tested positioning and messaging for optimal engagement."
outcome: "Increased average order value and improved conversions from users encouraged to add recommended items, with a notable uplift in cart value for those reaching free delivery."
