overview: "Added product reviews on Avon UK's product detail pages to build trust and encourage purchases. Customer reviews enhance trust and guide purchase decisions, increasing conversions."
challenge: "Users were hesitant to make purchase decisions without social proof, resulting in lower conversion rates."
hypothesis: "Adding product reviews to PDP will build trust and encourage users to make purchase decisions, leading to higher conversion rates."
implementation: "Integrated a product review section on the PDP, allowing customers to leave and read reviews. A/B tested different layouts and review visibility to optimise user trust and engagement."
outcome: "Increased user trust in products, leading to higher conversion rates and improved customer satisfaction."
