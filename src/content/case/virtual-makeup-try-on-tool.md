overview: "Introduced a virtual try-on tool on Avon UK to boost confidence and drive purchases. Virtual try-ons increase customer confidence and conversion rates in beauty categories."
challenge: "Users were hesitant to purchase makeup products online without the ability to visualise how they would look on their skin, leading to lower conversion rates."
hypothesis: "Introducing a virtual try-on feature for makeup will increase customer confidence and encourage more purchases by allowing users to virtually test products before buying."
implementation: "Integrated a virtual try-on tool on makeup PDPs, enabling users to upload photos or use their device cameras to test products. A/B tested the toolâ€™s placement and functionality to enhance user interaction and ease of use."
outcome: "Increased conversion rates, as users felt more confident in their purchase decisions after virtually trying on makeup products."
