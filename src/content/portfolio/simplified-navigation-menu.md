overview: "Redesigned Avon Lebanonâ€™s navigation menu and product categories based on user behaviour, benchmarking, and SEO keyword research. Clear, intuitive categorisation not only supports product discovery but also enhances the overall user journey, driving higher engagement and conversions."
challenge: "The existing navigation structure was aligned with internal business priorities rather than user preferences, leading to confusion and increased drop-off rates during browsing.
"
hypothesis: "Aligning the navigation menu and product categories with user expectations and SEO best practices will enhance product discovery, reduce bounce rates, and increase conversions."
implementation: "Conducted an in-depth analysis of user behaviour, complemented by SEO keyword research and competitor benchmarking. Restructured the menu hierarchy, simplified category names, and optimised subcategories for clarity and relevance."
outcome: "Improved user engagement with a 20% increase in time spent on site, a 15% reduction in bounce rates, and a 10% uplift in conversion rates, showing the positive impact of user-centred navigation."
