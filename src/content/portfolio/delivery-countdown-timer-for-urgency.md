overview: "Added a countdown timer for delivery on Avon UK to boost urgency, reducing cart abandonment and driving quicker conversions. Timely delivery information creates urgency, encouraging faster decisions and improving conversion rates."
challenge: "Users often abandoned their carts at the final checkout stage, particularly during the delivery phase, often due to uncertainty about delivery timelines."
hypothesis: "Introducing a countdown timer for One Day Delivery will encourage users to complete their purchases faster, increasing conversion rates by tapping into their fear of missing out (FOMO)."
implementation: "Added a countdown timer to the PDPs, indicating fast shipping delivery times. A/B tested the copy and placement."
outcome: "Increased One Day Delivery conversions, with a noticeable reduction in cart abandonment rates."
