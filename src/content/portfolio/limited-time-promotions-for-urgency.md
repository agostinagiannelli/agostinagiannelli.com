overview: "Introduced limited-time promotions with countdown timers on Avon Malta to drive urgency and prompt faster purchasing. Time-sensitive offers create a sense of urgency, encouraging quicker decisions and boosting conversions during promotions."
challenge: "Users were not acting quickly enough on limited-time offers, resulting in missed conversion opportunities during promotional periods."
hypothesis: "Implementing countdown timers on time-sensitive promotions will encourage users to make quicker purchase decisions, leading to higher conversion rates."
implementation: "A/B tested time-sensitive promotions with countdown timers displayed both on PDPs and throughout the checkout process to optimise urgency and prompt faster purchases."
outcome: "Increased conversion rates for products offered within limited-time."
