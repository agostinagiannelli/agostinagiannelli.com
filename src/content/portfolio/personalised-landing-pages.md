overview: "Developed personalised landing pages on Avon UK, dynamically adjusting content based on user behaviour and preferences. Tailored experiences increase relevance and foster engagement, driving higher conversions and user satisfaction."
challenge: "Static landing pages failed to resonate with returning visitors or cater to individual user needs, leading to lower engagement and reduced conversion potential."
hypothesis: "Dynamically personalising landing page content based on user data will improve relevance, foster engagement, and ultimately drive higher conversion rates."
implementation: "Built personalised landing pages by leveraging user data, including browsing history and purchase behaviour. Dynamically updated content such as featured products, banners, and CTAs for returning users. A/B tested different levels of personalisation to identify the most impactful strategies."
outcome: "Improved user engagement and increased conversion rates, with personalised landing pages driving more meaningful interactions and better-aligned shopping experiences."
