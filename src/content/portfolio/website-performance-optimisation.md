overview: "Optimised Avon UK website load speed by eliminating unnecessary scripts, and compressing images. Faster load times improve user retention and drive quicker decisions, resulting in higher engagement and conversion rate."
challenge: "The website had slow load times due to excessive scripts and large, unoptimised images, leading to a high bounce rate and poor user experience."
hypothesis: "By optimising the website's speed, users would experience quicker load times, stay longer on the site, and be more likely to complete a purchase."
implementation: "Collaborated with development team to remove unnecessary scripts and with content team to optimise image file sizes without losing quality. Focused on enhancing critical rendering paths and mobile-first optimisation to ensure a fast, responsive experience."
outcome: "Faster loading website, reduced bounce rate, and increased in conversion rates, as users were more likely to stay and interact with the site."
