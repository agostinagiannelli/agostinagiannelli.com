overview: "Introduced an interactive cart drawer on Avon Malta that opens automatically when a product is added, encouraging users to proceed to checkout. Minimising friction and providing instant feedback with a cart drawer encourages users to proceed to checkout."
challenge: "Users often added items to their carts but abandoned the session without proceeding to checkout, indicating friction in the path to purchase."
hypothesis: "An interactive cart drawer, immediately displaying the added product and checkout option, will reduce friction, boost urgency, and increase conversion rates."
implementation: "Implemented a cart drawer that appears when a product is added, showcasing cart contents and a prominent 'Proceed to Checkout' button. A/B tested the design and timing to optimise user engagement and minimise drop-offs."
outcome: "Significant improvement in checkout initiation rates, a smoother user experience, and reduced cart abandonment."
