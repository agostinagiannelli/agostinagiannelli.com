overview: "On Avon Malta, showcased skincare products tailored to user needs for better relevance. Personalised recommendations improve engagement and drive higher conversion rates."
challenge: "Users searching for skincare products were overwhelmed by choices, and many were unsure which products were most relevant to their needs."
hypothesis: "Showcasing skincare products based on individual skin concerns will enhance relevance, making it easier for users to find suitable products and increasing conversions."
implementation: "Created a section on PDP that categorised skincare products by skin concern (e.g., acne, dryness, anti-aging), personalising the shopping experience. A/B tested the categories to optimise user interaction."
outcome: "Increased product engagement and higher conversion rates for skincare products."
