overview: "Featured items commonly bought together to enhance cross-selling on Avon UK. Showing related products increases average order value and boosts conversions."
challenge: "Customers were not discovering complementary products, resulting in missed cross-selling opportunities and lower average order values."
hypothesis: "Featuring products commonly bought together will encourage users to purchase more items, increasing the average order value."
implementation: "Added a 'Frequently Bought Together' section on PDP, showcasing related products that customers often purchase in combination. A/B tested the section's layout and placement for maximum user engagement."
outcome: "Higher AOV due to increased cross-selling opportunities and user engagement with recommended product bundles."
